		  Guys, first of all I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk with you. My name is James McGuiness and my site is PointSpreadPros.com
		 I have been on the internet since 1998 doing NFL football handicapping exclusively until this year, where I began doing NBA.
		 <p>
		 I don't know if you have dealt with handicapping services in the past, but the industry has a very bad reputation and I understand if you are leary and
		 untrusting. That is the percise reason I posted my NBA plays on the RX forum. What better way to gain peoples trust then to put the picks out there and
		 have you decide if they are any good.
		 <p>
		 <b>What I want to do for all of my members, is to treat this like an investment club, not a tout service</b>. I bet every one of my NFL and NBA plays, that you can be sure.
		 So my hard earned money is out there with yours. We are in this together as a team.
		 <P>
		 <b>What you can expect from me is honesty, hard work and excellent customer service, and my pricing is as good as it gets</b>. Most handicapping services won't show you their records or 
		 have any "credentials" about why you should trust them. <b>On my site, you will see EVERY play from every newsletter win or lose with a complete record</b>. If you go to my NFL portion of my site, you
		 can see all the past picks from this year.
		 <p>
		 My NFL credentials are that I have used my computer systems to <b>successfully come in the TOP 10 of the Ultimate Handicapping Challenge THREE times</b>. This is an independent contest
		 of the best services out there. So my results have been documented by someone else. If you look at the past history of that contest, you will see <b>no other service has come in
		 the top 10 more than ONCE, I have done it THREE times</b> and I am proud of that accomplishment. I think that proves the consistency of my systems.
		 <p>
		 <b>Since 1998 my NFL picks have won approximately 64% of the time, I have member testimonials to back up my claims</b> I do not give out a lot of plays, but I hit a high percentage of them. I stress quality over quantity.
		 <p>
		 <b>For the rest of this year what I am proposing is a modest $1.75/day subscription price for my NBA newsletter</b>. I use PAYPAL for my website, it is perfectly safe and secure
		 to use and they have an automatic billing option for subscriptions. <b>Why so cheap? I want to make this affordable for everyone</b>, while I can make a little money off a large membership.
		 <p>
		 Once you purchase a subscription, PAYPAL will automatically bill your credit card or bank account so you don't have to do a thing. You may cancel at any time and I
		 will have an automatic cancellation once the NBA playoffs start. So you won't need to remember to cancel yourself.
		 <p>
		 To begin a subscription for only $1.75/day, please click the button below, once you have purchased you will begin receiving my plays:
		 <b><font size="+1">Once CAVEAT, you may NOT POST MY PICKS ON THE RX or any other FORUM. If this happens then the $1.75 becomes a mute point and we all lose out.
		 Lets face it, I would then have to charge at least $50 for one poor person to buy it, then post it for free to make it worth my while, and I don't want to do that.
		 So please, lets keep this within our own community, for $1.75 I would hope you can respect this request!
		 </font></b>

		 If anyone has an issue with this type of payment, and would like to pay in a different way, I am totally flexible, you can contact me at jmcguin1@nycap.rr.com
		 but I would really prefer if you used the PAYPAL option, it is the easiest and most secure way to do business.
		 
		 <p>
		 Please also visit my site <a href="http://www.pointspreadpros.com">here</a> and have a look around. You can read more about me and my computer systems there.
		 <p>
		 Thanks so much for the interest, I will work as hard as humanly possible to make us profitable!
